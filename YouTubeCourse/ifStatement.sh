# #Expressions 
# An expression can be: String comparison, Numeric comparison, File operators and Logical operators and it is represented by [expression]:
# String Comparisons:  
# ---------------------------------
# =  compare if two strings are equal
# !=  compare if two strings are not equal
# -n  evaluate if string length is greater than zero
# -z  evaluate if string length is equal to zero 

# Examples: 
# [ s1 = s2 ]  (true if s1 same as s2, else false)
# [ s1 != s2 ]  (true if s1 not same as s2, else false)
# [ s1 ]   (true if s1 is not empty, else false)
# [ -n s1 ]   (true if s1 has a length greater then 0, else false)
# [ -z s2 ]   (true if s2 has a length of 0, otherwise false)

# Number Comparisons: 
# ------------------------------------
# -eq compare if two numbers are equal
# -ge compare if one number is greater than or equal to a number
# -le  compare if one number is less than or equal to a number
# -ne  compare if two numbers are not equal
# -gt  compare if one number is greater than another number
# -lt  compare if one number is less than another number 

# Examples: 
# [ n1 -eq n2 ]  (true if n1 same as n2, else false)
# [ n1 -ge n2 ]  (true if n1greater then or equal to n2, else false)
# [ n1 -le n2 ]  (true if n1 less then or equal to n2, else false)
# [ n1 -ne n2 ]  (true if n1 is not same as n2, else false)
# [ n1 -gt n2 ]  (true if n1 greater then n2, else false)
# [ n1 -lt n2 ]  (true if n1 less then n2, else false)

#We have two ways to compare things
#1
count=10
if [[ count -eq 10 ]]
then
        echo "The compared things are the same"
fi
#2
if (( $count >= 10 ))
then
        echo "True"
fi 

#Comparing strings
letter=c
if [[ $letter > d ]]
then
        echo "The letter is higher"
elif [[ $letter == c ]]
then
        echo "They're the same letter"
else
        echo "The letter is not higher"
fi
