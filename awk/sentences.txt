#AWK STANDARD OPTIONS

#-v option -> It assigns values to a variable before the program execution
awk -v name=Jerry 'BEGIN{printf "Name = %s\n", name}'

#--dump-variables[=file] option -> It prints a sorted list of global variables and their final 
#values to file. The default file is awkvars.out.
awk --dump-variables ''
cat awkvars.out 

#--help option -> This option prints the help message on standard output.
awk --help

#--lint[=fatal] option ->This option enables checking of non-portable or dubious constructs. 
#When an argument fatal is provided, it treats warning messages as errors. 

#--posix option -> This option turns on strict POSIX compatibility, in which all 
#common and gawk-specific extensions are disabled.
SIN EJEMPLO

#--profile[=file] option -> This option generates a pretty-printed version of the program 
#in file. Default file is awkprof.out. 
awk --profile 'BEGIN{printf"---|Header|--\n"} {print} END{printf"---|Footer|---\n"}' marks.txt > /dev/null 

#--traditional option -> This option disables all gawk-specific extensions.
SIN EJEMPLO

#--version option -> This option displays the version information of the AWK program.
awk --version

#/a/ -> this is like an if statement, if the thing that we're looking for exists
# it gets the searched thing, otherwise, it shows everything
awk '/a/ {print $0}' marks.txt
awk '/a/' marks.txt -> as this sentence has no cryteria to look for, it prints everything

#PRINTING COLUMNS IN ANY ORDER
awk '/a/ {print $4 "\t" $3}' marks.txt

   print "ARGIND   = ", ARGIND; print "Filename = ", ARGV[ARGIND] 
}' junk1 junk2 junk3

#BINMODE
#It is used to specify binary mode for all file I/O on non-POSIX systems. 
#Numeric values of 1, 2, or 3 specify that input files, output files, or all files,
#respectively, should use binary I/O. String values of r or w specify that input 
#files or output files, respectively, should use binary I/O. String values of rw or 
#wr specify that all files should use binary I/O.

#When this variable is set, GAWK becomes case-insensitive. 
awk 'BEGIN{IGNORECASE = 1} /amit/' marks.txt

#such as real and effective UID numbers, process ID number, and so on.

IMCREMENT AND DECREMENT 
------------------

#Pre-Increment
#It is represented by ++. It increments the value of an operand by 1. 
#This operator first increments the value of the operand, 
#then returns the incremented value. For instance, in the following example,
#this operator sets the value of both the operands, a and b, to 11.
awk 'BEGIN { a = 10; b = ++a; printf "a = %d, b = %d\n", a, b }'

#Pre-Decrement
#It is represented by --. It decrements the value of an operand by 1. 
#This operator first decrements the value of the operand,
#then returns the decremented value. For instance, in the following example,3
#this operator sets the value of both the operands, a and b, to 9.
awk 'BEGIN { a = 10; b = --a; printf "a = %d, b = %d\n", a, b }'

#Post-Increment
#It is represented by ++. It increments the value of an operand by 1.
#This operator first returns the value of the operand, then it increments 
#its value. For instance, the following code sets the value of operand a to 11 and b to 10.
awk 'BEGIN { a = 10; b = a++; printf "a = %d, b = %d\n", a, b }'

#Post-Decrement
#It is represented by --. It decrements the value of an operand by 1. 
#This operator first returns the value of the operand, 
#then it decrements its value. For instance, the following 
#code sets the value of the operand a to 9 and b to 10.
awk 'BEGIN { a = 10; b = a--; printf "a = %d, b = %d\n", a, b }'

------------------

Assignment Operators

#Simple Assignment

awk 'BEGIN { name = "Jerry"; print "My name is", name }'

#Shorthand Addition
#It is represented by +=.
awk 'BEGIN { cnt = 10; cnt += 10; print "Counter =", cnt }'

#Shorthand Subtraction
#It is represented by -=
awk 'BEGIN { cnt = 100; cnt -= 10; print "Counter =", cnt }'

#Shorthand Multiplication
#It is represented by *=.
awk 'BEGIN { cnt = 10; cnt *= 10; print "Counter =", cnt }'

#Shorthand Division
#It is represented by /=. 
awk 'BEGIN { cnt = 100; cnt /= 5; print "Counter =", cnt }'

#Shorthand Modulo
#It is represented by %=.
awk 'BEGIN { cnt = 100; cnt %= 8; print "Counter =", cnt }'

#Shorthand Exponential
#It is represented by ^=.
awk 'BEGIN { cnt = 2; cnt ^= 4; print "Counter =", cnt }'


#Shorthand Exponential
#It is represented by **=.
awk 'BEGIN { cnt = 2; cnt **= 4; print "Counter =", cnt }'

RELATIONAL OPERATORS
----------------------
#Equal to
#It is represented by ==. It returns true if both operands are equal, 
#otherwise it returns false.
awk 'BEGIN { a = 10; b = 10; if (a == b) print "a == b" }'

#Not Equal to
#It is represented by !=. It returns true if both operands are unequal,
#otherwise it returns false.
awk 'BEGIN { a = 10; b = 20; if (a != b) print "a != b" }'

#Less Than
#It is represented by <. It returns true if the left-side operand is less 
#than the right-side operand; otherwise it returns false.
awk 'BEGIN { a = 10; b = 20; if (a < b) print "a  < b" }'

#Less Than or Equal to
#It is represented by <=. It returns true if the left-side operand is 
#less than or equal to the right-side operand; otherwise it returns false.
awk 'BEGIN { a = 10; b = 10; if (a <= b) print "a <= b" }'

#Greater Than
#It is represented by >. It returns true if the left-side operand is greater
#than the right-side operand, otherwise it returns false.

LOGICAL OPERATORS
--------------

#Logical AND
#It is represented by &&. Its syntax is as follows 
#expr1 && expr2
#It evaluates to true if both expr1 and expr2 evaluate to true; 
#otherwise it returns false. expr2 is evaluated if and only if expr1 evaluates to true. 
 awk 'BEGIN {
   num = 5; if (num >= 0 && num <= 7) printf "%d is in octal format\n", num 
}'

#Logical OR
#It is represented by ||. The syntax of Logical OR is
#expr1 || expr2
#It evaluates to true if either expr1 or expr2 evaluates to true; 
#otherwise it returns false. expr2 is evaluated if and only if expr1 evaluates to false. 
#The following example demonstrates this −
awk 'BEGIN {
   ch = "\n"; if (ch == " " || ch == "\t" || ch == "\n") 
   print "Current character is whitespace." 
}'

#Logical NOT
#It is represented by exclamation mark (!). The following example demonstrates this
#! expr1
#It returns the logical compliment of expr1. If expr1 evaluates to true, it returns 0;
#otherwise it returns 1. For instance, the following example checks 
#whether a string is empty or not.
awk 'BEGIN { name = ""; if (! length(name)) print "name is empty string." }'

----------------

TERNARY OPERATORS 
---------------------
#We can easily implement a condition expression using ternary operator.
#The following example demonstrates this
#condition expression ? statement1 : statement2
#When the condition expression returns true, statement1 gets executed;
#otherwise statement2 is executed.
awk 'BEGIN { a = 10; b = 20; (a > b) ? max = a : max = b; print "Max =", max}'
